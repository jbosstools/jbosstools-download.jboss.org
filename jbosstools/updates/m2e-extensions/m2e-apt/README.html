The following folders should never be removed as they are part of composite 
requirement sites used for current/previous JBoss Tools releases:

Indigo SR2
	* 1.0.0-2012-06-05_16-15-59-H16

Juno SR1 (can be removed when we have a Juno SR2 target platform instead, if anything newer exists)
	* 1.0.1-2012-09-20_03-20-41-H23
