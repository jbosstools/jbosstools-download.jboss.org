  This site composites the latest target platform used to 
  build and test JBoss Tools, for this specific Eclipse
  stream. However, this URL is deprecated as content has
  moved: <a href="http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/targetplatforms/jbtistarget/kepler/">targetplatforms/jbtistarget/kepler/</a>

  See also <a href="../../requirements/">../../requirements</a>/*/build.xml for how mirrors are produced.

  <a href="http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/targetplatforms/">Target platform sites</a> are then <a href="https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/tree/master/target-platform">produced</a> from the above mirrors using
  Tycho to resolve, mirror, and validate.
