  This site composites the latest target platform used to 
  build and test the 3rd Party content in JBoss Central, 
  for this specific Eclipse stream. However, this URL is 
  deprecated as content has moved to: 

  <a href="http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/targetplatforms/jbtcentraltarget/kepler/">targetplatforms/jbtcentraltarget/kepler/</a>

  See also <a href="../requirements/">../requirements</a>/*/build.xml for how mirrors are produced.

  <a href="http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/targetplatforms/">JBoss Central target platform sites</a> are then <a href="https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-discovery/tree/jbosstools-4.1.x/jbtcentraltarget">produced</a> from the above mirrors using
  Tycho to resolve, mirror, and validate.
