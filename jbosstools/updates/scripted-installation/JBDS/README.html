<pre>
There are two major ways to install Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio:

a) Using the izpack <a href="https://devstudio.jboss.com/earlyaccess/7.0/"><b>installer jar</b></a>, which will install a self-contained product which includes Eclipse:

  * Download the jar
  * `java -jar /path/to/jbdevstudio-*.jar`

b) Using an update site to install into an existing Eclipse you've already installed:

  * Using the Eclipse Marketplace: <a href="https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/red-hat-jboss-developer-studio-kepler">https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/red-hat-jboss-developer-studio-kepler</a>
  * Using the JBoss Developer Studio update site: <a href="https://devstudio.jboss.com/updates/7.0/">https://devstudio.jboss.com/updates/7.0/</a>

In both cases, this can be done interactively as above, or can be scripted for headless or hands-free installation 
(eg., should you want to install JBoss Developer Studio onto multiple computers in parallel).

  To script the izpack installer to create installation(s) headlessly, see:

    * <a href="jbds-install.cmd">jbds-install.cmd</a> (Windows)
    * <a href="jbds-install.sh">jbds-install.sh</a> (Mac or Linux)

  To script installation into an existing Eclipse install, optionally also installing other features from JBoss Central or another site, see:

    * <a href="installJBDS.xml">installJBDS.xml</a> (See also <a href="../">../README.html</a> for more examples and shell script wrappers.)
