  This site composites the latest target platform used to 
  build and test JBoss Tools, for this specific Eclipse
  stream. However, this URL is deprecated as content has
  moved: <a href="http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/targetplatforms/jbosstoolstarget/juno/">targetplatforms/jbosstoolstarget/juno/</a>

  See also <a href="../requirements/">../requirements</a>/*/build.xml for how mirrors are produced.

  <a href="http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/targetplatforms/">Target platform sites</a> are then <a href="https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-target-platforms/tree/4.22.x">produced</a> from the above mirrors using
  Tycho to resolve, mirror, and validate.
